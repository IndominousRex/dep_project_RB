      "No match for  ['I m a [M/] A guy and I both know each other but never spoke a word  how can I approach him. Before telling you about my problem that I seek advice for  let me tell you about my personality. I don t have any real friends  I just have acquaintances  if you will  people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally  I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most  Science and music  I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself  I was like this since I was a kid  so due to this my social skills aren t great  I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I d turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However  I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to  as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I m speaking with  I am good.  With that said  over the past year  I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding  I genuinely don t fully understand how this relationship  If you could call it that in the first place  developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library  this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table  so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word  and I m pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place  days went by and everyday I went to the library I d sit in the same place and the same goes for him  even when the library was completely empty we d sit in the exact same place  by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I m pretty sure we d feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his  and this is where the bollocks started  we got to see one another way more often  In the corridor  the bathroom  on the way out to the buses  and as we passed by eachother  we d always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word  we both know eachother but pretended that we didn t. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends  we still wouldn t directly speak but if I say a joke he s going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy  I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke  I d like to say hi  but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I d melt  and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don t even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn t like me or consider me a friend  maybe I m just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning  I don t know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning  I guess we both arrive at the same time . So this is a short version of what happened  this is bugging me and I ve been losing sleep over it  what do I do?  Sorry for the long post and rubbish grammar  English isn t my first language  Thanks in advance.', 0]\n",

      "No match for  ['Best guy friend is ignoring me  and I don t understand why My best guy friend  Jake   not his real name  have known each other for  years. We are now both  years old. Of all the friends I currently have  I ve been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger  so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school  and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school  I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness  lost a significant amount of weight  and managed to find a small group of friends in my school s anime club. Throughout all this  Jake was a very steady  loyal  and supportive friend  and I m forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges  both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times  we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently  I met a great guy  Aaron   not his real name  in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home  so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup  I invited  friends from high school  including Jake   I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn t say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative  I m usually the quieter one in our friendship   so I pulled him aside and asked him what s wrong. He said nothing  so I figured nothing was wrong.   That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago  I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he s mad at me. No response. I don t understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me  but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school  and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He s not the shy type  so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years.', 0]\n",

Started off fun  wed go for lunch  gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text.   For the last  months shes stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages  or sending any . Instead she calls me at least once every week for often  -  hours asking for advice about men  her job and other stresses. Shell talk for over  mins uninterrupted  wont stop talking when I need to go and will call even if Ive said Ill be out or unavailable.   I got married oversees recently and our conversation was  mins on this and the remaining  hours about her problems.   She gets aggressive if I dont offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where shes gotten into an argument  and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didnt mean it how it came across she will say I dont defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. Shell ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesnt give her the result she wanted!  Its confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now Im left with her constantly calling. If I dont pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls.   Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries.
