Nothing feels authentic when im here. There have been beautiful times in my life and % of them are when ive been abroad.

I have been suffering from depression since I was  (now ) but I've only recently thought of it as 'depression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I was jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had was fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide notes and when I could read them without crying then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. (This one I couldn't do) finally it all got too much. In my head, my parents were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sisters I was too annoying that they wouldn't miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took  paracetamol (not knowing then that they can't actually kill you) and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for ages and I started to get more scared - what would my parents think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever things get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident as I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressants for  months now. For the rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a 'blanket' over how I'm feeling and I'm not addressing the real issues; not that I know what they are. I can't get motivated to study, go to class, go out, anything. I don't care. I don't see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our worlds are all the creation of our minds and once our minds are dead, so is our world so there's no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I don't think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god, whatever you conceive him to be (if anything) should have the only power over life and death, but why does he take some people and not others? (More specifically, me?) I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who loves life - but as yet has been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die, why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands, like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course, there's always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scares me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind, thinking away for ever.... are my feelings wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just don't see the point in being here - anyone have the answers I'm looking for? Life is pointless.\n",

Its always like I try something and want to better myself, have high expectations and then life comes, uppercuts me, spits on me and just screams You thought, bitch.   I had a really good therapist but she suddenly quit due to illness.    I had to wait several months until I got the final answer. Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like  sessions.   Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just dont vibe with her that much. And I cant change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since Im a broke ass student.    I told her once that I dont want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now its all solutions again. Try this, try that, we need to experiment. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again.   My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter.    I really miss that feeling.   Now its just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it.   But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just dont want to go anymore and give up. I dont have energy for that.   I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings.   But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns.    I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants.   My new therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one.   At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid Id do something to myself.   Now no one cares. Im alone. I dont go outside anymore. Im just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and Im just a bother to everyone.    I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself.   Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of Of course, I will try! I will do my best.   Im good at pretending nothing bothers me and everythings fine. Im good at pretending to say Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!.   But Im just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more.    Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I havent killed myself yet is because itd financially ruin my family.   I dont even care about emotions, I doubt itd be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they dont get into debt with my death or sth.    I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die.   I dont feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they dont put as much energy into me as I put into them.    Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really dont know how much of this I can take.   Ive been like this since  years old. Im  now. I dont know why I got thrown into this world when Im ridden and infested with mental illnesses.\n",

At the age of  I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder which I do not think I have. Anyways I was hospitalized twice medicines worked for a while but then I would just crash down into a further depression. At the age of  I stopped all medicines because I was happy and didn't think they were really doing anything to help me. Since that time I still suffer occasional bouts of depression. I will also add in that my mom has schizoaffective disorder and that I have many aunts and uncles with depression. I am now soon to be  and I just feel very alone. I am married and I work and go to school right now. I am just overwhelmed I don't want to go to my classes I don't feel like it is worth my time I feel like no one cares if I succeed or fail. I have had these feelings before this is the same way I felt when I dropped out of high school. I just feel worthless the only thing I even enjoy anymore is work and lately that has not given me much enjoyment at all I use to be eager to be there and now I am anxious to get off of work and come home and not do anything. My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately he has an anger problem that we have been trying to work through, and it is negatively impacting the way I feel. I can also tell though that he is worried about me he keeps asking me if I am ok or if I am mad at him I just don't really feel anything right now I am just numb. I just have a million thoughts running through my head and no matter what I do I can't seem to get rid of the negativity. I am tired all the time, yet I can't sleep at night that well but I have been falling asleep in the middle of the afternoons. I overreact to little things and the list goes on. I know what can happen if I let this go on. I nearly lost my life to the negative thoughts when I was younger that is the only reason I got help then. I have decided to see my doctor and get some help I just think I need some support I have no friends around here well at least that have any time to visit and my family is all  hours away.\n",

Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People dont care, they pity me. They realize, then, that Im a hopeless situation and they cant help me at all because they really cant. No one can. Therapies dont help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. Its not really a bad idea, its the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just dont know why I cant. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesnt agree with me. Its always either Im too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school.

To date I have written four major writings (,-   pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year, when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life.  But, I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing.  You see, she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace, but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now, I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything.

      ".*(no one|nobody).*(cares|understands).*(me|you).* matches I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long.  Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me.  So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my () \"genuine\" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm \"stealing\" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there).  Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of \"Stop asking for attention and actually do something\". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either.   So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me.  There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed \"smart\", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so \"smart\" and able to do anything. With currently a ~ average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do.  I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like ~ years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end.  I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past  months have been excruciating, and I haven't gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I don't know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I don't want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I'm just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I'm tired of living and feeling like shit. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I'm close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I'm not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say isn't meaningless or invalid. I don't want to feel alone. I don't ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone this because I don't want them to walk out of my life.  I'm sorry if this seemed really petty and like I'm just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. :/ I just feel kinda down right now and I haven't been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months.   So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall.\n",

HOPE.  so if you got it, send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not \"appearing\" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter, but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt, necessarily, but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways, and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about  feet away. goodnight moon.\n",
      ".*(no one|nobody).*(cares|understands).*(me|you).* matches I was in a really really good mood. i even offered to stay  extra hours at work. i do that all the time. they ask me to stay and the nice person i am i do. I dont want to anymore. im tired of being treated like a lesser person then them its not fair. i didnt do anything. i do my job and im nice to them. but some of them just treat me like im a inferior person. im so tired of that, everyone thinks there better then me. my manager would yell at me at anything i asked. or give me looks of hate. i asked for my break and she got all mad. then  minutes before the time i said id stay tell i asked who was taking my place i got yelled at in front of everyone \"you still have  minutes and ill put someone back there so get back there!\" then she turns and continues to talk to her friend that had come in, and becca gave me snide remarks and laughed. im sorry, i do recall that i was supposed to get off  hours prior to this but i stayed for you bitch. its like they enjoy humiliating me. beccas always saying things like \"no one cares what you think or say\" i hate my job. they made me cry. i hate them\n",

      ".*(no one|nobody).*(cares|understands).*(me|you).* matches I'm bored but strangly happy today. I did nothing today (except workout) and it was awesome. My color is Copper and I taste like honey. I like that; better than tasting like copper. Honey is sweet, so I think it fits me well; however it is also sticky and annoying. I shall ignore those attributes of the honeyness. But honey is pretty...and well, we've been over that before. And if you don't know what pretty is, pretty = hot. I know, I know; it's all very confusing. Just know that when a girl calls you pretty, its not that bad of a thing (Most of the time). My alarm clock just went off...how odd.  Julia called again, dont really want to talk to her. She and Crystal came out on Friday after the Fair fiasco. I went to Tiffany to escape them. I prolly would have had a VERY VERY good time, but I don't want to have the pressure of that looming over my head, should I decide to never speak to them again. Sure, Im not going to turn it down if its  right there , but with both of them here it would have been weird. Don't ask why, it just would have. Tiff says Im turning into a man slut. I disagree.  If these are the best years of our lives, I'm-a-thinking preimptive suicide may not be such a bad idea. I mean, just cut off the pain early, ya know? Nah, I wouldnt ever do anything like that, but it is an interesting theory. I do like to get things done early and death is a thing. heh. Don't know where this is going, but thats whats kinda cool. I think this is better than a Xanga. Kody's profile says that no one cares what I do all day. Well, shit,  I  don't care what I do all day. These aren't really for others to read, I mean they are, but they aren't. I see them as more of an outlet; for me atleast. I need money and I need alot of it. If I had money chicks would dig me. They would, they would. I need money, a cool hair cut and leather jacket. Hell, I wanna be The Fonze. He's one cool nigga. He can walk into a room, get some kickass music playin, some sweet chicks and get free food. Yeah, I wanna be the Fonze. Well, Im all out of brain power.   Copper / Honey , Out.\n",

A Human Thesis w/ a Photography Minor  Getting to Know a Stranger is a human project looking to get to know someones life by giving an hour (I always encourage it to go longer) to Getting to Know Stranger that other wise I would have never met. There is no monetary exchange only one of friendship and kindness. I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick!   Getting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.. you know every type of Human!   I know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us.  So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction.   A little about me!       My name is Aaron Bistrin I am a  year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up. However it wasn't always easy growing, Santa Cruz can be a tricky place to navigate as youth and I found myself in quite a bit of trouble very young.  This continued into my early s and after a series of life changing events I started to make some serious changes in my life. As one positive lead to another, I found myself opening a restaurant in my home town at the age of . Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger.   If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin.com. All meeting are private unless the consent from both people is given. This is a project of human kindness. Hope to meet you soon!  Much love! Aaron B\n",
      ".*(no one|nobody).*(cares|understands).*(me|you).* matches Whats the worst thing a friend has ever said to you?  I have two stories.   . This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $ iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said this is her Christmas present. My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that.   . This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how Im lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I dont deserve my Masters degree because I didnt work as hard for mine since I didnt have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but nobody cares about you. She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldnt be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesnt give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying.   Sometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this.\n",
      ".*(no one|nobody).*(cares|understands).*(me|you).* matches Close friend suddenly turned cold I have a friend who's had some mental and anxiety issues in the past. We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically.  They have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc.   At a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their lifeso as far as I know, it's not a lie.  Anyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic.   Anyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was.  Then...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well.  Now, she's cold and distant. Not %, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldnt use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and Ive asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. Shes definitely changed; it's definitely not just me.  Supposedly, shes looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get Well, I suppose thats very kind of you when I express concern for how she is and How do I know that youre not rolling your eyes? when I express that I care and What possible use could I be to you when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too. These are all usual parts of the conversation and nothing out of the ordinary from my side.  Her manner and actions are a huge backflip, because less than a month ago she expressed how important and vital my friendship was to her because shedefinitivelyknew I cared about her (and suspected others didnt). She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear I need balance in my life, as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two thingsbetter mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide inare not mutually exclusive.  Ive lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. Im looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because Im hurting and its already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue.   I don't want to cut them off because they really do mean a hell of a lot to me, but is that all I can do here? I've tried to just back way off for the moment and see if they realise what they've done on their own.  P.S. This is a six-year friendship. Did not just evolve to being close overnight.\n",
      ".*(no one|nobody).*(cares|understands).*(me|you).* matches I moved , miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited I'm unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid.    I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!).  My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot.  She always says \"maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!\"  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own.    I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him.    I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not.  I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it.  They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live.  It's been six years!  My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $ plane ticket.    What should I do?  Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine?  Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me?  Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I've already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit).   Thanks!\n",
